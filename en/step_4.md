## Create the team

Synchronised swimming needs more than one cat! We can use `create clone of`{:class="blockcontrol"} to create copies that behave in the same way. 

--- task ---

First let's add code to make sure the cat always starts in the same position when you click the green flag.

```blocks
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
point in direction (90 v)
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test your code by pressing some arrow keys and then clicking the green flag to return to the start position.

Now we can use a `repeat`{:class="blockcontrol"} loop to create 6 clones (copies) of the cat.

```blocks
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
point in direction (90 v)
+repeat (6)
create clone of [myself v]
end
```

Loops are used to do the same thing multiple times.

You don't want all the cats to be in the same position! 

Add code to rotate 60 degrees before creating each clone.

```blocks
when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
point in direction (90 v)
repeat (6)
+turn cw (60) degrees
create clone of [myself v]
end
```

 Test your code by using the arrow keys. You should be able to create some amazing synchronised swimming patterns!
