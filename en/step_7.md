## Challenge: code your own routine

Can you write your own synchronised swimming routine to be performed when you press the space key or another key?

Try working out a routine using the arrow keys first. 

Use `repeat`{:class="blockcontrol"} loops to perform the same actions multiple times. 

Here's an example:

![swimmer sprite](images/swimmer-sprite.png)

```blocks
when [m v] key pressed
repeat (8)
	turn cw (45) degrees
	repeat (20)
		move (5) steps
	end
	repeat (20)
		move (-5) steps
	end
end
```
